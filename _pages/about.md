I am a Master's student in Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University.
Before that, I received my Bachelor's degree in Artificial Intelligence from Shanghai Jiao Tong University. 
My research interests lie at the intersection of machine learning and computational biology:

- Designing novel, efficient machine learning algorithms to solve problems in genomics and understand complex biological systems;
- Leveraging data-driven and interpretable approaches to uncover biological mechanisms from large-scale sequencing data;
- Modeling biological processes to reveal their regulatory impact on gene regulation.

In my free time, I enjoy reading, music, and learning new languages. I am also a big fan of movies and fancy web technologies.
