I am an incoming PhD student in EECS at MIT, starting in Fall 2025. 
I earned my MS in Computer Science from Carnegie Mellon University, where I worked with Prof. [Jian Ma](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~jianma/). 
Prior to that, I received my Bachelor's degree in Artificial Intelligence from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, advised by Prof. [Jinjin Li](https://www.aimslab.cn/) and Prof. [Xiaoyun Zhang](https://mediabrain.sjtu.edu.cn/xiaoyun-zhang/).
My research interests lie at the intersection of machine learning and computational biology. 
I am particularly interested in:

- Designing novel and efficient machine learning algorithms to tackle problems in genomics and better understand complex biological systems;
- Developing data-driven, interpretable methods to uncover biological mechanisms from large-scale sequencing data;
- Modeling biological processes to elucidate their regulatory roles in gene expression and regulation.

In my free time, I enjoy reading, music, and picking up new languages (the human kindâ€“though I've learned a few machine ones too).
I'm also a movie enthusiast and have a keen interest in modern web technologies.
